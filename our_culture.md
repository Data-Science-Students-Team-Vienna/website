# Our Culture

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Equality & No Hierarchy</span>

Everyone in the team is equalâ€”there is no hierarchy. Decisions are made 
collectively, and every member's input is valued equally. 

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Voluntary Participation</span>

Joining the team and participating does not come with obligations. Every 
contribution is entirely optional. Members can choose their level of involvement
based on their availability and interest.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Prize Money Eligibility</span>

While participation is voluntary, active contribution is required to be eligible
for prize money. For detailed information on this, refer to the Prize Money 
Rules page.

We encourage a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone can 
contribute at their own pace and comfort level.
