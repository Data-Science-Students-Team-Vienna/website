# Prize Money Rules

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Allocation of Prize Money</span>
**Team Budget (50%)**  
Half (50%) of the total prize money from any challenge will be allocated to the 
Data Science Team's budget. This budget is exclusively for team-related 
expenses, such as paying for cloud computing or other resources needed for our
work.

**Active Members' Share (50%)**  
The other half (50%) of the prize money will be divided equally among all active
members of the challenge team.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Definition of Active Members</span>
**Regular Participation**  
An "active member" is defined as someone who regularly attends meetings 
related to the challenge and actively contributes to its progress.

**Disputes on Active Status**  
If there’s disagreement about whether someone qualifies as an active 
member—such as if someone claims to be active but isn’t recognized or if 
others believe a person did not contribute—this will be resolved through a 
group vote.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Voting Procedure for Disputes</span>
1. **Active Members Can Vote**
   Only people that are undisputed active members can participate in the vote.

2. **Anonymous Voting**  
   Voting will be conducted anonymously to ensure all participants feel 
   comfortable being honest.

3. **Quorum for Voting**  
   At least two-thirds (2/3) of the active members involved in the challenge 
   must participate in the vote for it to be valid.

4. **Majority Decision**  
   If a person receives 50% or more of the vote, the decision is finalized. 
   This applies to determining whether someone is considered an active member.

5. **Finality of Results**  
   The results of the vote are binding, and the group will proceed based on the 
   decision.
